# The Wild Oasis üõñ
A website to manage the activities of a boutique hotel called The Wild Oasis. 

This website was part of Jonas Schmedtmann's React course. I learned a lot of the real-world things that are used in production-level websites from coding along with Jonas on this project. After finishing the project, Jonas left some challenging tasks to enhance this project. 

_**As part of completing those challenges, I implemented the Guests section and added the functionality of adding new bookings and editing the existing bookings. These tasks helped me to hone the skills that Jonas has taught throughout this course.**_

## Notes üóíÔ∏è
Only already existing users can create new user accounts on this site. Once a new user account is created, that user can log in to the website and update their necessary info i.e. their name, profile picture, etc. Before adding a booking for a new guest, the user must add the respective guest first and then proceed to add the booking. 

_**I have added the email and password for a demo account in the login form so everyone can view the website. So, just click the login button to view the website.**_
