# The Wild Oasis üõñ

A website to manage the activities of a boutique hotel called The Wild Oasis.

This website was part of Jonas Schmedtmann's React course. I learned a lot of the real-world things that are used in production-level websites from coding along with Jonas on this project. After finishing the project, Jonas left some challenging tasks to enhance this project.

_**As part of completing those challenges, I implemented the Guests section, adding new bookings, editing the existing bookings and, signup page. These tasks helped me to hone the skills that Jonas has taught throughout this course.**_
